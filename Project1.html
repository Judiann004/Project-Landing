        TIG stands for tungsten inert gas and is technically called gas tungsten
        arc welding (GTAW). The process uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode
        that delivers the current to the welding arc. The tungsten and weld
        puddle are protected and cooled with an inert gas, typically argon. TIG
        welding is similar to oxy-acetylene welding in that you use a filler
        material for build-up or reinforcement

            How does a TIG welder work?
          </strong>
          <br />
          TIG machines use a foot-operated variable amperage control. After the
          maximum amperage desired is pre-set on the machine, this allows you to
          vary the amperage up to the maximum pre-set amperage. This is useful
          when welding alloy steels, such as <em>4130 chrome-moly</em>. The foot
          control allows you to slowly initiate the heat, and after the weld is
          complete you can slowly reduce the heat.This soft start and soft stop
          prevents temperature shocking the metal. Many alloy steels used in
          race cars are sensitive to thermal shock. Welding by other means may
          lead to brittle welds.
